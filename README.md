# Secure chat
P2P chat application where sensible messages are encrypted.

We implemented three protocols:
-	Ephemeral RSA: to exchange temporary keys between server and clients
-	Needhamâ€“Schroeder Protocol (Denning-Sacco variant): to exchange keys between clients
-	Hash Functions: to store passwords

Protocol analisys is avaible using BAN Logic in this [report](https://github.com/djqwert/secure-chat/blob/master/Report.pdf) file.
